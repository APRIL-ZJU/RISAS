# RISAS: A Robust RGB-D Feature Invariant to Rotation, Illumination and Scale

RISAS is a novel RGB-D keypoint detector and feature descriptor. 

For more details, please refer to  <https://person.zju.edu.cn/yongliu>

## Contents:
- ManipulatorsDataset: The constructed RGB-D evaluation benchamark dataset with individual variation.
- RISAS_detector: A Matlab implementation of RISAS detector.
- RISAS_descriptor: A Matlab implementation of RISAS descriptor.

## Usage:
Our approach is operated on Matlab and needs VLFeat package. Firstly, please download VLFeat <http://www.vlfeat.org/> and run /vlfeat/toolbox/vl_setup.m in Matlab.
